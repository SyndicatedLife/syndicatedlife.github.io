    <h1>Ryan Wilson</h1>
    <p>I've lived in four provinces and driven across the country. I enjoy anime and MMORPG/JRPG's.</p>
    <p>I write <a href="https://www.github.com/Icehunter" target="_blank">code</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/SyndicatedLife" target="_blank">idiotic comments</a> about random things.</p>
    <p>Mentoring a "start fast" team on best engineering standards and driven technilogical impact.</p>
    <p>Machine learning is my new Overlord.</p>
    <p>I was in charge of health informatics, scaling and "watchdog" services for <a href="https://www.msn.com">MSN</a> and various other services.</p>
    <p>I am working with some awesome people right now to disrupt the status quo.</p>
    <p>I've run a community application project for <a href="https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/">Final Fantasy XIV</a> since 2010. Check it out <a href="https://xivapp.com">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Favourite Quote:</h3>
    <blockquote>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not: the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan Press On! has solved and will always solve the problems of the human race.<p>- Calvin Coolidge</p></blockquote>
